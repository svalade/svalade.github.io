Using high-resolution satellite radar imagery enhanced with deep-learning, we image the repetitive dome construction-subsidence cycles at Popocatépetl volcano (Mexico) with very high temporal and spatial resolution. We show that these cycles resemble gas-driven rise and fall of the upper magma column, where buoyant bubble-rich magma is extruded from the conduit (in ~hours-days), and successively drained back (in ~days-months) as magma degasses and crystallizes. These cycles are superimposed on a progressive decadal crater deepening, accompanied by heat and gas flux decrease, which could be partially explained by gas depletion within the magma plumbing system. Results reinforce the idea that gas retention and escape from the magma column play a key role in the short- and long-term morphological evolution of low-viscosity lava domes and their associated hazards.","tags":[],"title":"Lava dome cycles reveal rise and fall of magma column at Popocatépetl volcano","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Balazs Markus","Sébastien Valade","Manuel Wöllhaf","Olaf Hellwich"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675460280,"objectID":"31abcbc475fc37dadfc3ff8d0bfb5d1f","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/markus-2023/","publishdate":"2023-02-03T21:38:00.532104Z","relpermalink":"/publication/markus-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Automatic retrieval of volcanic SO2 emission source from TROPOMI products","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sébastien Valade"],"categories":null,"content":"Funding: DGAPA PAPIIT\n","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"c22b4ab68cdd89c583132f610080751c","permalink":"https://example.com/projects/2023-papiit-campion/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/2023-papiit-campion/","section":"projects","summary":"Study of active lava lake formation and potential drainage processes.","tags":null,"title":"Classification and formation processes of lava lakes","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Silvana Hidalgo","Francisco Javier Vasconez","Jean Battaglia","Benjamin Bernard","Pedro Espín","Sébastien Valade","María-Fernanda Naranjo","Robin Campion","Josué Salgado","Marco Córdova","Marco Almeida","Stephen Hernández","Gerardo Pino","Elizabeth Gaunt","Andrew Bell","Patricia Mothes","Mario Ruiz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675460280,"objectID":"12571bbfa859e681951d31a9fbe2603d","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/hidalgo-2022/","publishdate":"2023-02-03T21:38:00.746908Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hidalgo-2022/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Sangay volcano (Ecuador): the opening of two new vents,  a drumbeat seismic sequence and a new lava flow in late 2021","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mathieu Gouhier","Virginie Pinel","Joaquín M.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
